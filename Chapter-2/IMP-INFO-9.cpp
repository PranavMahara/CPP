// Scope
// A variableâ€™s scope, also called visibility, describes the locations within a program from which it
// can be accessed. It can be referred to in statements in some parts of the program; but in others,
// attempts to access it lead to an unknown variable error message. The scope of a variable is that
// part of the program where the variable is visible.
// Variables defined within a function are only visible, meaning they can only be accessed, from
// within the function in which they are defined.
