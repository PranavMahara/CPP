// A large-scale program with several users is used to perform bookings.
// Only authorized users, that is, users that have access to the password, are
// allowed to perform bookings.
// In the initial stages of program development, you need to test the
// functionality of the source file, Passw2.cpp.To do so, create a new
// source file with a main function that contains only the following menu
// items in its main loop:
// B = Booking
// E = End of program 
// When B is typed, the password is first checked. If the user enters the
// correct password, he or she can change the password.The program does
// not need to perform any real bookings.
