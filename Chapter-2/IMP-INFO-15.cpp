// C-strings are arrays of type char. The last character in a C-string must be the null character,
// ‘\0’. C-string constants take a special form so that they can be written conveniently: the text is
// surrounded by double quotes. A variety of library functions are used to manipulate C-strings.
// An array of C-strings is an array of arrays of type char. The creator of a C-string variable must
// ensure that the array is large enough to hold any text placed in it. C-strings are used as arguments to C-style library functions and will be found in older programs. They are not normally
// recommended for general use in new programs.

// Write a statement that inserts the string “cat” into string s1 at position 12.
// s1.insert(12, “cat”);



// Write an expression that accesses a structure member called salary in a structure variable that is the 17th element in an array called emplist.
// emplist[16].salary


// Write a statement that defines an array called manybirds that holds 50 objects of type bird.
// bird manybirds[50];


// You can read input that consists of multiple lines of text using  the cin.get() function with three arguments.


// Write a statement that defines a string variable called city that can hold a string of up to 20 characters
// char city[21] (An extra byte is needed for the null character.) 


// Write a statement that defines a string constant, called dextrose, that has the value “C6H12O6-H2O”
// char dextrose[] = “C6H12O6-H2O”;
