// Write a C++ Program using pointer to take a list of n strings as input using an array.
// Write a function rev_sort_str() to print the reverse of the names present in the string in sorted order using
// pointer and count the number of strings in the array which is a palindrome
// If count is zero, then print "None of the strings is a palindrome"
