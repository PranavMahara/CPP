// The Date class does not ensure that an object represents a valid date.To avoid
// this issue, add range checking functionality to the class. Range checking is
// performed by the constructor and the setDate() method with three
// parameters.
//      ■   First, write a function called isLeapYear() that belongs to the bool
//          type and checks whether the year passed to it is a leap year. Define the
//          function as a global inline function and store it in the header file
//          Date.h.
//      ■   Modify the setDate() method to allow range checking for the date
//          passed to it.The constructor can call setDate().
//      ■   Test the new version of the Date class.To do so, and to test setDate(...), read a date from the keyboard.
