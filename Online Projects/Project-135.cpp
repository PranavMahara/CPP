// Write a C++ program to compute the sum of the numbers in a given array except those numbers starting with 5 followed by atleast one 6. Return 0 if the given array has no integer.

// Sample Input:
// { 1, 5, 9, 10, 17 }
// { 1, 5, 6, 9, 10, 17 }
// Sample Output:
// Sum of the numbers of the said array except those numbers starting with 5 followed by atleast one 6:
// 42
// Sum of the numbers of the said array except those numbers starting with 5 followed by atleast one 6:
// 37
