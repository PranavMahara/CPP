//  Write a C++ program to break a given integer in at least two parts (positive integers) to maximize the product of those integers.Sample Input: n = 5
// After breaking in +ve integers maximumn product from 5 = 6
// Sample Input: n = 12
// After breaking in +ve integers maximumn product from 12 = 81
