// Programming Language is the collection of header files and functions
// Header Files --> Information about predefined functions
// Functions --> Set of instructions which need to be followed

// #include<iostream>       # is preprocessor derivative
                            // Include is a key word used for providing path
                            // <> holding pre-defined header-files
                            // User Defined header files can be shown with the help of ""

// Data-Types Format that data has to stored and accessed
// Int, Float, Char, String, Bool

// Namespace is a new concept introduced by the ANSI C++ standards committee. This 
// defines a scope for the identifiers that are used in a program. For using the identifier 
// defined in the namespace scope we must include the using directive, like 
//  Using namespace std; 
// Here, std is the namespace where ANSI C++ standard class libraries are defined. All 
// ANSI C++ programs must include this directive. This will bring all the identifiers defined 
// in std to the current global scope. Using and namespace are the new keyword of C++. 

// Functions are the building blocks of C++ programs where all the program activity 
// occurs. Function is a collection of declarations and statements. 

// The two lines that begin the FIRST program are directives. The first is a preprocessor directive,
// and the second is a using directive. They occupy a sort of gray area: They’re not part of the
// basic C++ language, but they’re necessary anyway

// The type file usually included by #include is called a header file.
