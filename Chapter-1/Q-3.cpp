//  for loop with a semicolon is called as body-less for loop. It is used only for incrementing the variable values. So in this program, the value is incremented and printed as 10.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++); {
        cout << i;
    }

    cout<<i+122;
    return 0;
}
