// Usually there are mainly two type of bugs, logical errors and syntactic errors. The 
// logical errors occur due to poor understanding of problem and syntactic errors arise due 
// to poor understanding of language. There are some other problems called exceptions that 
// are run time anomalies or unused conditions that a program may encounter while 
// executing. These anomalies can be division by zero,access to an array outside of its 
// bounds or running out of memory or disk space. When a program encounters an 
// exceptional condition it is important to identify it and dealt with it effectively.An 
// exception is an object that is sent from the part of the program where an error occurs to 
// that part of program which is going to control the error.
