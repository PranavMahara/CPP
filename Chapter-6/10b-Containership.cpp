// Difference between Inheritance and Containership

/*
Containership: Containership is the phenomenon of using one or more classes within the definition 
of other class. When a class contains the definition of some other classes, it is referred to as 
composition, containment or aggregation. The data member of a new class is an object of some 
other class. Thus the other class is said to be composed of other classes and hence referred to as 
containership. Composition is often referred to as a “has-a” relationship because the objects of the 
composite class have objects of the composed class as members.

Inheritance: Inheritance is the phenomenon of deriving a new class from an old one. Inheritance 
supports code reusability. Additional features can be added to a class by deriving a class from it and 
then by adding new features to it. Class once written or tested need not be rewritten or redefined.
Inheritance is also referred to as specialization or derivation, as one class is inherited or derived from 
the other. It is also termed as “is-a” relationship because every object of the class being defined is 
also an object of the inherited class
